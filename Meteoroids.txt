What I am aiming for is a basic, almost "Asteroids" style space shooter, but with extra customization. The main changes I'll be making off of the normal Asteroids formula are a set of parts you can change on the ship, and different weapons to fire, and possibly different armor and speeds for the parts, making the player make a decision between protection and mobility. Adding custom features, I believe, gives the player a feeling of agency over the game they play, making it a more personal experience.
