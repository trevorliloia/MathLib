In the making of my game, as with most, I thought I'd have to abandon mot of the features to finish it, but I feel my goals were reached, since this time I took more time to actually plan out what I could feasibly do in the time given. The player is able to fire four different types of bullet that behave differently, and equip four types of ship hull that alters the amount of shield HP the player can have. In this project I think I built the extra features and graphics pretty well, but I could have done better on the core of the game, namely improved the AI and maybe the controls too. Overall I think I handled my time better in this project, and was able to reach my goals faster.
